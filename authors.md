## Paper Submission Guidelines

Authors wishing to have papers considered for CWIT should electronically submit their full papers in PDF format through [EDAS](https://edas.info/newPaper.php?c=18401) using the [standard IEEE two-column format](www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html). 

Accepted papers will be published on IEEE Xplore and in the proceedings of the workshop.

The maximum paper length is four (4) printed pages (10-point font), without incurring additional page charges. A maximum of one (1) extra page is allowed, with the additional page charge of C$100.00.

The deadline for the full-length papers submission is **<strike>January 30, 2015</strike> February 21, 2015**.

Papers are reviewed on the basis that they do not contain plagiarized material and have not been submitted to any other conference at the same time (multiple submission). To learn more about the IEEE policy on plagiarism and multiple submission, please see : 

* [IEEE Introduction to the Guidelines for Handling Plagiarism Complaints](http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/plagiarism.html)
* [IEEE Introduction to Guidelines on Multiple Submission and Prior Publication](ihttp://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/Multi_Sub_Guidelines_Intro.html)

**Papers need to be presented by one of the authors in order to be included in the proceedings of the conference; under exceptional circumstances, a different presenter is accepted. Authors need to contact the TPC Chairs beforehand to obtain the permission that somebody different than an author presents the paper. Also, accepted papers must be accompanied by a full registration; each full registration covers one paper. Details on registration are available at [http://www.cwit.ca/2015/registration.html](http://www.cwit.ca/2015/registration.html).**

If you have any questions regarding the submission of manuscripts, please contact one of the Technical Program Co-Chairs.

## Student Awards and Travel Grants

We are pleased to be able to offer student travel grants and awards for this year's CWIT. Five will be selected to receive a travel grant of $200 to help offset the cost of travel to St. John's. Selection will be based on review of the paper submitted to the conference.

Additional this year's conference will offer awards to the top papers presented. The awards will include a certificate of recognition as well as $500, $300, and $200 to the first, second, and third place papers respectively.

At the submission, please, identify the first authors who are students. Papers with students as first authors, who will also present their papers at CWIT 2015, will be considered for travel grants and awards.
