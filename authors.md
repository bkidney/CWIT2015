## Paper Submission Guidelines

Authors wishing to have papers considered for CWIT should electronically submit their full papers in PDF format through [EDAS](https://edas.info/newPaper.php?c=18401) using the [standard IEEE two-column format](www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html). 

Accepted papers will be published on IEEE Xplore and in the proceedings of the workshop.

The maximum paper length is four (4) printed pages (10-point font), without incurring additional page charges. A maximum of one (1) extra page is allowed, with the additional page charge of C$100.00.

The deadline for the full-length papers submission is **January 15, 2015**.

Papers are reviewed on the basis that they do not contain plagiarized material and have not been submitted to any other conference at the same time (multiple submission). To learn more about the IEEE policy on plagiarism and multiple submission, please see :
