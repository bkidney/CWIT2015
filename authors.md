## Submission Guideline for Camera Ready Papers

The authors of accepted papers are kindly asked to follow the steps below for the final phase of the submission process: 

Step 1: Revise your paper according to the reviewer's comments and recommendations. 

The revised paper will not be further reviewed!

Step 2: Format final version of your paper according to IEEE authors' guidelines. It is mandatory to use the template available [www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html](http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html).

Step 3: Convert your source file in pdf format and check its IEEE Xplore compatibility using IEEE PDF eXpress Plus™ according to the instructions provided in the file [pdf_instructions_authors.pdf](files/pdf_instructions_authors.pdf). If the test is successfully passed, upload your PDF file on EDAS.

Step 4: Register the paper. One full registration per paper is required (please, see registration information at [http://cwit.ca/2015/registration.html](http://cwit.ca/2015/registration.html)).

Step 5: Complete copyright form. All accepted papers must be accompanied with an IEEE Copyright Form. CWIT 2015 has registered to use the IEEE Electronic Copyright (eCF) service. Authors of accepted papers are allowed to complete copyright forms by going to “My Papers” tab and clicking on the '(c)' icon under the column “Copyright Form” where their paper is located. This icon directs authors to an IEEE site and that site then reports back once the author has completed the copyright form. You will also receive an email from IEEE Electronic Copyright Service with the signed copyright form (in PDF format) as attachment.

IMPORTANT: No paper without a completed IEEE Copyright Transfer Form will be published.

Step 6: Upload your paper to EDAS directly to “Final Manuscript” by selecting the upload icon. Submissions are due by March 30, 2015.
