*Title:* Underwater Wireless Communication: An Overview of Challenges and Recent Results

*Abstract:* Underwater wireless communications rely on transmission of acoustic waves, since electro-magnetic waves propagate only over very short distances. Acoustic communications thus form an integral part of autonomous undersea systems, which find application in basic sciences (oceanography, marine biology), industry (off-shore oil, aquaculture), environment monitoring (climate, pollution, seismic disturbances) and security (search-and-rescue, surveillance). 

Acoustic waves, however, are confined to low frequencies (usually no more than several tens of kHz) because of energy absorption, and the bandwidth available for communication is extremely limited. Sound travels underwater at a very low speed (nominally 1500 m/s) and propagation occurs over multiple paths. Delay spreading over tens or even hundreds of milliseconds results in a frequency-selective signal distortion, while motion creates an extreme Doppler effect. The worst properties of radio channels—poor link quality of a mobile terrestrial channel, and long delay of a satellite channel—are thus combined in an underwater acoustic channel, which is often said to be the most difficult communication medium in use today.

The quest for bandwidth-efficient acoustic communications has progressed over the past two decades from an initial feasibility proof of phase-coherent detection, to the development of the first high-speed acoustic modem, and finally to a plethora of innovative solutions on both the signal processing and the networking fronts. In this presentation, we begin with an overview of channel characteristics, focusing on the major differences between underwater acoustic and terrestrial radio channels. We follow with a discussion of signal processing methods, briefly overviewing single-carrier broadband equalization used in an existing acoustic modem, and focusing on recent research results in multi-carrier signal detection on highly time-varying, Doppler-distorted channels. The performance of various techniques is illustrated through experimental results, which include transmissions over few kilometers in shallow water to hundreds of kilometers in deep water, at highest bit-rates demonstrated to date. We conclude by outlining the open research problems.

*Title:* Shine a Light: Optical Wireless Communications

*Abstract:* For the past  twenty years, wireless radio frequency local area networks (LANs) have operated successfully in the  2.4 GHz band and the 5 GHz bands. Signals from  these bands do not confine themselves to a given room or even household,so security and frequency re-use are issues for concern. An alternative to radio frequency LANs are diffuse intensity-modulated wireless optical LANs. Optical wireless LANs are more secure than radio waves as light does not move through walls. In addition because this method of communications will use available LED-based office lighting  to send information, it is an environmentally-friendly technology. This talk will focus on efficient methods for using diffuse  optical wireless communications. Issues such as complexity, efficiency and the ability to operate in environments with intensity-limited lighting will be discussed.

*Bio:* Sarah Kate Wilson received her A.B. from Bryn Mawr College with honours in Mathematics in 1979 and her Ph.D. from Stanford University in Electrical Engineering in 1994. She has worked in both industry and academia and has been a visiting professor at Lulea University of Technology, the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm,  Stanford University and Northeastern University.  She is an Associate Professor at Santa Clara University. She has served as an Editor for IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, IEEE Communications Letters and IEEE Transactions on Communications and  the Editor-in-Chief of IEEE Communications Letters. She is a Fellow of the IEEE and the Vice-President for Publications  of the IEEE Communications Society.

*Title:* A Broader View of the Superposition Construction of LDPC Codes
 
*Abstract:* LDPC codes, discovered by Gallager in 1962 and rediscovered in late 1990’s, are currently the most promising coding technique to achieve close to the Shannon capacities for a wide range of channels. Since their rediscovery, many methods for constructing LDPC codes have been proposed. Major construction methods can be classified in to two general categories, the algebraic-based and the graph-based constructions. The superposition (SP) construction is one of the earliest algebraic-based methods for constructing LDPC codes which was proposed in 2002. In this presentation, this specific algebraic-based construction method is re-interpreted in a broader view which includes both algebraic (or matrix-theoretic) and graph-theoretic point of views. From the algebraic point of view, it is shown that the SP-construction of LDPC codes covers several major algebraic construction methods developed after 2002 as special cases. From the graph-theoretic point of view, it shown that the protograph (PTG)- based construction of LDPC code, introduced in 2003, is a special case of the superposition construction. In fact, the PTG-based construction of LDPC codes can be viewed as an algebraic construction. This significantly simplifies the construction of LDPC codes based on protographs.

In 1965, he joined the Faculty of the University of Hawaii, Honolulu, as an Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering. He became an Associate Professor in 1969 and a Professor in 1973. In 1986, he joined Texas A&amp;M University, College Station, as the Irma Runyon Chair Professor of Electrical Engineering. In 1987, he returned to the University of Hawaii. From 1978 to 1979, he was a Visiting Scientist at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, where he worked on error control protocols for data communication systems. He spent the academic year of 1996-1997 as a Visiting Chair Professor at the Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.

He retired from University of Hawaii in 1999 and he is currently an Adjunct Professor at University of California, Davis, California. He has published at least 800 technical papers in prestigious refereed technical journals and international conference proceedings. He is the author of the book, An Introduction to Error-Correcting Codes (Englewood Cliff, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1970). He also co-authored (with D. J. Costello) the book, Error Control Coding: Fundamentals and Applications (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1st edition, 1982, 2nd edition, 2004), the book (with T. Kasami, T. Fujiwara, and M. Fossorier), Trellises and Trellis-Based Decoding Algorithms, (Boston, MA: Kluwer Academic, 1998), and the book, Channel Codes: Classical and Modern (Cambridge University Press 2009).

Dr. Lin was elected to IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineering) Fellow in 1980 and Life Fellow in 2000. In 1996, he was a recipient of the Alexander von Humboldt Research Prize for U.S. Senior Scientists and a recipient of the IEEE Third-Millennium Medal, 2000. In 2007, he was a recipient of The Communications Society Stephen O. Rice Prize in the Field of Communications Theory. In 2014, he was awarded the NASA Exceptional Public Achievement Medal.
