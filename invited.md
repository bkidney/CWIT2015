*Title:* Underwater Wireless Communication: An Overview of Challenges and Recent Results

*Abstract:* Underwater wireless communications rely on transmission of acoustic waves, since electro-magnetic waves propagate only over very short distances. Acoustic communications thus form an integral part of autonomous undersea systems, which find application in basic sciences (oceanography, marine biology), industry (off-shore oil, aquaculture), environment monitoring (climate, pollution, seismic disturbances) and security (search-and-rescue, surveillance). 

Acoustic waves, however, are confined to low frequencies (usually no more than several tens of kHz) because of energy absorption, and the bandwidth available for communication is extremely limited. Sound travels underwater at a very low speed (nominally 1500 m/s) and propagation occurs over multiple paths. Delay spreading over tens or even hundreds of milliseconds results in a frequency-selective signal distortion, while motion creates an extreme Doppler effect. The worst properties of radio channels—poor link quality of a mobile terrestrial channel, and long delay of a satellite channel—are thus combined in an underwater acoustic channel, which is often said to be the most difficult communication medium in use today.

The quest for bandwidth-efficient acoustic communications has progressed over the past two decades from an initial feasibility proof of phase-coherent detection, to the development of the first high-speed acoustic modem, and finally to a plethora of innovative solutions on both the signal processing and the networking fronts. In this presentation, we begin with an overview of channel characteristics, focusing on the major differences between underwater acoustic and terrestrial radio channels. We follow with a discussion of signal processing methods, briefly overviewing single-carrier broadband equalization used in an existing acoustic modem, and focusing on recent research results in multi-carrier signal detection on highly time-varying, Doppler-distorted channels. The performance of various techniques is illustrated through experimental results, which include transmissions over few kilometers in shallow water to hundreds of kilometers in deep water, at highest bit-rates demonstrated to date. We conclude by outlining the open research problems.

*Title:* Shine a Light: Optical Wireless Communications

*Abstract:* For the past  twenty years, wireless radio frequency local area networks (LANs) have operated successfully in the  2.4 GHz band and the 5 GHz bands. Signals from  these bands do not confine themselves to a given room or even household,so security and frequency re-use are issues for concern. An alternative to radio frequency LANs are diffuse intensity-modulated wireless optical LANs. Optical wireless LANs are more secure than radio waves as light does not move through walls. In addition because this method of communications will use available LED-based office lighting  to send information, it is an environmentally-friendly technology. This talk will focus on efficient methods for using diffuse  optical wireless communications. Issues such as complexity, efficiency and the ability to operate in environments with intensity-limited lighting will be discussed.

*Title:* A Broader View of the Superposition Construction of LDPC Codes
 
*Abstract:* LDPC codes, discovered by Gallager in 1962 and rediscovered in late 1990’s, are currently the most promising coding technique to achieve close to the Shannon capacities for a wide range of channels. Since their rediscovery, many methods for constructing LDPC codes have been proposed. Major construction methods can be classified in to two general categories, the algebraic-based and the graph-based constructions. The superposition (SP) construction is one of the earliest algebraic-based methods for constructing LDPC codes which was proposed in 2002. In this presentation, this specific algebraic-based construction method is re-interpreted in a broader view which includes both algebraic (or matrix-theoretic) and graph-theoretic point of views. From the algebraic point of view, it is shown that the SP-construction of LDPC codes covers several major algebraic construction methods developed after 2002 as special cases. From the graph-theoretic point of view, it shown that the protograph (PTG)- based construction of LDPC code, introduced in 2003, is a special case of the superposition construction. In fact, the PTG-based construction of LDPC codes can be viewed as an algebraic construction. This significantly simplifies the construction of LDPC codes based on protographs.

*Title:* Coding and Modulation for Optical Communication Systems: Replacing the Soft FEC Limit Paradigm

*Abstract:* The demand for global IP communication bandwidth is continuously growing at a current estimated rate of approximately 20% per year. Most of this demand is met by optical fiber communications, which transports over 95% of all digital data traffic around the globe. Optical fibers were traditionally viewed as a medium with unlimited capacity. However, in recent years, the seemingly never-ending data traffic increase together with the impact of fiber nonlinearities have created the need to increase the spectral efficiency of coherent optical transceivers. 

Forward error correction (FEC) and multilevel modulation formats are one of the key technologies for realizing high spectral efficiencies in optical communications. The combination of FEC and multilevel modulation is known as coded modulation, where FEC is used to recover the sensitivity loss caused by the nonbinary modulation. While in the past optical communication systems were based on hard-decision FEC, modern systems use soft-decision FEC, such as turbo product codes or low-density parity-check codes.

To meet higher-layer quality of service requirements, the bit-error rate (BER) target after decoding (post-FEC BER) is typically around 10^-15. Since such low BER values cannot be reliably estimated by Monte-Carlo simulations or experiments with offline digital signal processing, the conventional design paradigm has been to simulate the system without FEC encoding and decoding, and optimize it for a much higher BER requirement, the so-called "FEC limit" or "FEC threshold". Under this paradigm, the existence of a FEC code that brings down the BER after decoding to the desired target level is assumed. 

In this talk, we challenge the FEC limit paradigm and show that the concept of a channel-independent FEC limit is invalid for soft-decision bit-wise decoding and low to medium code rates. A better predictor is the generalized mutual information (GMI), which is shown to give consistent post-FEC BER predictions across different channel conditions and modulation formats. The "GMI threshold" paradigm is suggested as the relevant design tool for modern optical communication systems. Extensive optical full-field simulations and experiments in both the linear and nonlinear transmission regimes confirm the theoretical analysis.

*Title:* Efficient Distributed Collaborative Beamforming Designs for Real-World Applications

*Abstract:* Collaborative beamforming (CB), alternatively known as cooperative multi-antenna relaying, stands out today as a strong means to increase coverage, reliability, and capacity of various wireless networks by implementing through a set of terminals (sensor nodes, mobiles, network relays, soldier radios, vehicles, etc.) dual-hop transmissions between transmitter-receiver pairs when direct links would otherwise fail. Distributed CB (DCB) designs, in particular, lend themselves to distributed processing implementations that avoid the costly overhead required otherwise to broadcast the CB weights after their calculation by some master terminals. Many impediments stand, however, between the exciting concept of DCB and its real-world and wide-use applicability. In this talk, we present novel DCB designs, obtained in closed form, that dot require any data exchange between terminals, yet properly cope, as dictated by a broad range of applications, with both scattered and interfered multi-antenna dual-hop transmissions under different power constraints. We also analyze the performance of these new DCB designs in terms of SNR and link-level throughput, both by newly established theoretical closed-form expressions and simulations. to illustrate their spectrum, power, and computational-cost efficiency in operating conditions that account for various implementation imperfections.
